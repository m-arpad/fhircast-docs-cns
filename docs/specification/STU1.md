# FHIRcast
## !! Modified !!
Please note that this is a modified version of the [original FHIRCast specification](http://fhircast.org/specification/STU1/). It contains extensions proposed by the Cerner-Nuance-Siemens Collaboration in order to

1. Support Near-Real-Time Exchange of Clinical Case information to be used in various integration scenarios between different systems.
2. Improve the robustness, security and deployability of the solution in various networks environments including those protected by firewalls and proxies.
3. Decrease latency of event notifications

The major additions/changes to the standard are:

* Added 'Sharing of Structured Information in a Case'
* Added 'update-case' event
* Replaced WebSub-based service-to-client communication with WebSockets

## Overview
The FHIRcast specification describes the APIs and interactions to synchronize healthcare applications in real time to show the same clinical content to a user. All data exchanged through the HTTP APIs MUST be sent and received as [JSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) structures, and MUST be transmitted over channels secured using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS), also known as HTTPS and defined in [RFC2818](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818). FHIRcast utilizes [WebSockets](https://github.com/HL7/fhircast-docs/wiki/Websocket-proposal) for bi-directional communication, specifically all calls from service to client. FHIRcast also builds on the [HL7 SMART on FHIR launch protocol](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch).

An app subscribes to specific workflow events for a given session, the subscription is verified and the app is notified when those workflow events occur; for example, by the clinician opening a patient's chart. The subscring app may query a session's current context and initiate context changes by accessing APIs exposed by the Hub. The app deletes its subscription when it no longer wants to receive notifications. In all cases the app authenticates to the Hub with an OAuth 2.0 bearer token. 

## Session Discovery
Before establishing a subscription, an app must know the `hub.topic` which is an unique url identifying the session, and the `cast-hub` which is the base url of the Hub. The app discovers these two urls as part of a SMART on FHIR launch. 

The app MUST either be launched from the driving application following the [SMART on FHIR EHR launch](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch#ehr-launch-sequence) flow or the app may initiate the launch following the [SMART on FHIR standalone launch](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#standalone-launch-sequence). In either case, the app MUST request and be granted the `fhircast` OAuth2.0 scope. Accompanying this scope grant, the authorization server MUST supply the `cast-hub` and `hub.topic` SMART launch parameters alongside the access token. These parameters identify the Hub's base url, and a unique, opaque identifier of the current user's session, respectivly. Per SMART, when scopes of `openid` and `fhirUser` are granted, the app will additionally receive the current user's identity in an `id_token`.

### SMART Launch Example
Note that the SMART launch parameters include the Hub's base url and and the session identifier in the `cast-hub` and `hub.topic` fields.

```
{
  "access_token": "i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "patient":  "123",
  "encounter": "456",
  "imagingstudy": "789",
  "cast-hub" : "https://hub.example.com",
  "hub.topic": "https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu",
}
```
Although FHIRcast works best with the SMART on FHIR launch and authorization process, implementation-specific launch, authentication, and authorization  protocols may be possible. See [other launch scenarios](/launch-scenarios) for guidance.

## Subscribing and Unsubscribing

Subscribing consists of two phases:

* Subscriber requests a subscription at the `cast-hub` url and as a response receives a websocket address to connect to.
* Subscriber connects to the websocket address and starts to listen for messages being sent to it through the websocket channel.

Unsubscribing works in the same way, except with a single parameter changed to indicate the desire to unsubscribe.

### Subscription Request
To create a subscription, the subscribing app SHALL perform an HTTP POST ([RFC7231](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/#bib-RFC7231)) to the Hub's base url (as specified in `cast-hub`) with the parameters in the table below.

This request SHALL have a `Content-Type` header of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and SHALL use the following parameters in its body, formatted accordingly:

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
---------- | ----- | -------- | --------------
`hub.mode` | Required | *string* | The literal string "subscribe" or "unsubscribe", depending on the goal of the request.
`hub.topic` | Required | *string* | The uri of the user's session that the subscriber wishes to subscribe to or unsubscribe from. 
`hub.events` | Required | *string* | Comma-separated list of event types from the Event Catalog for which the Subscriber wants notifications.
`hub.channel.type` | Required | *string* | The literal string "websocket"
`hub.lease_seconds` | Optional | *number* | Number of seconds for which the subscriber would like to have the subscription active, given as a positive decimal integer. Hubs MAY choose to respect this value or not, depending on their own policies, and MAY set a default value if the subscriber omits the parameter. 

If OAuth2 authentication is used, this POST request SHALL contain the Bearer access token in the HTTP Authorization header.

Hubs SHALL allow subscribers to re-request subscriptions that are already activated. Each subsequent and verified request to a Hub to subscribe or unsubscribe SHALL override the previous subscription state for a specific topic / callback URL combination.

#### Subscription Request Example
In this example, the app asks to be notified of the `open-patient-chart` and `close-patient-chart` events.
```
POST https://hub.example.com
Host: hub.example.com
Authorization: Bearer i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

hub.mode=subscribe&hub.topic=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.example.com%2F7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu&&hub.events=patient-open-chart,patient-close-chart&hub.channel.type=websocket
```

### Subscription Response
If the Hub URL supports FHIRcast and is able to handle the subscription or unsubscription request, the Hub MUST respond to a subscription request with an HTTP 202 "Accepted" response to indicate that the request was received. The response MUST contain the WebSocket URI that the client will need to connect to in order to start receiving notifications.

If a Hub finds any errors in the subscription request, an appropriate HTTP error response code (4xx or 5xx) MUST be returned. In the event of an error, the Hub SHOULD return a description of the error in the response body as plain text, used to assist the client developer in understanding the error. This is not meant to be shown to the end user. Hubs MAY decide to reject some clients or topic URIs based on their own policies.

#### Subscription Response Example
```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

wss://hub.example.com/ee30d3b9-1558-464f-a299-cbad6f8135de
```

### Subscription Denial

If (and when) the subscription is denied, the Hub SHALL inform the subscriber by sending an HTTP GET request to the subscriber's callback URL as given in the subscription request. This request has the following query string arguments appended, to which the subscriber SHALL respond with an HTTP success (2xx) code.

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`hub.mode` | Required | *string* | The literal string "denied".
`hub.topic` | Required | *string* | The topic uri given in the corresponding subscription request.
`hub.events` | Required | *string* | A comma-separated list of events from the Event Catalog corresponding to the events string given in the corresponding subscription request. 
`hub.reason` | Optional | *string* | The Hub may include a reason for which the subscription has been denied. The subscription MAY be denied by the Hub at any point (even if it was previously accepted). The Subscriber SHOULD then consider that the subscription is not possible anymore.

#### Subscription Denial Example
```
GET https://app.example.com/session/callback/v7tfwuk17a?hub.mode=denied&hub.topic=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.example.com%2F7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu&hub.events=open-patient-chart,close-patient-chart&hub.reason=session+unexpectedly+stopped HTTP 1.1
Host: subscriber
```

### Unsubscribe

Once a subscribing app no longer wants to receive event notifications, it MUST unsubscribe from the session. The unsubscribe request message mirrors the subscribe request message with only a single difference: the `hub.mode` MUST be equal to the string _unsubscribe_.

#### Unsubscribe Request Example

```
POST https://hub.example.com
Host: hub
Authorization: Bearer i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

hub.mode=unsubscribe&hub.topic=https%3A%2F%2Fhub.example.com%2F7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu&hub.events=open-patient-chart,close-patient-chart&hub.channel.type=websocket&hub.channel.endpoint=wss%3A%2F%2Fhub.example.com%2F7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu_1A3DF21C14514DC58B593F824D3A7ED7

```


## Event Notification

The Hub SHALL notify subscribed apps of workflow events to which the app is subscribed, as the event occurs. The notification is an UTF-8 encoded JSON object sent through the WebSocket channel.

### Event Notification Request

The notification to the subscriber SHALL include a description of the subscribed event that just occurred, an ISO 8601-2 formatted timestamp in UTC and an event identifier that is universally unique for the Hub. The timestamp MAY be used by subscribers to establish message affinity (message ordering) through the use of a message queue. The event identifier MAY be used to differentiate retried messages from user actions.

#### Event Notification Request Details

The notification's `hub.event` and `context` fields inform the subscriber of the current state of the user's session. The `hub.event` is a user workflow event, from the Event Catalog. The `context` is an array of named FHIR resources (similar to [CDS Hooks's context](https://cds-hooks.org/specification/1.0/#http-request_1) field) that describe the current content of the user's session. Each event in the [Event Catalog](#event-catalog) defines what context is expected in the notification. Hubs MAY use the [FHIR _elements parameter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#elements) to limit the size of the data being passed while also including additional, local identifiers that are likely already in use in production implementations. Subscribers SHALL accept a full FHIR resource or the [_elements](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#elements)-limited resource as defined in the Event Catalog.

##### Event Notification Request Parameters

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`timestamp` | Required | *string* | ISO 8601-2 timestamp in UTC describing the time at which the event occurred with subsecond accuracy. 
`id` | Required | *string* | Event identifier used to recognize retried notifications. This id SHALL be unique for the Hub, for example a GUID.
`event` | Required | *object* | A json object describing the event. See [below](#event-notification-request-event-object-parameters).


Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`hub.topic` | Required | string | The topic session uri given in the subscription request. 
`hub.event`| Required | string | The event that triggered this notification, taken from the list of events from the subscription request.
`context` | Required | array | An array of named FHIR objects corresponding to the user's context after the given event has occurred. Common FHIR resources are: Patient, Encounter, ImagingStudy and List. The Hub SHALL only return FHIR resources that are authorized to be accessed with the existing OAuth2 access_token.

#### Event Notification Request Example

```
{
  "timestamp": "2018-01-08T01:37:05.14",
  "id": "q9v3jubddqt63n1",
  "event": {
    "hub.topic": "https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu",
    "hub.event": "open-patient-chart",
    "context": [
      {
        "key": "patient",
        "resource": {
          "resourceType": "Patient",
          "id": "ewUbXT9RWEbSj5wPEdgRaBw3",
          "identifier": [
             {
               "type": {
                    "coding": [
                        {
                            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
                            "value": "MR",
                            "display": "Medication Record Number"
                         }
                        "text": "MRN"
                      ]
                  }
              }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Query for Current Context

In addition to receiving notification of events as they occur, a subscribing app may request the current context of a given session. The client queries the Hub's `hub.topic` url to receive the current context for the session. Event-driven context notifications should take precedence. Note that no `hub.event` is present in the response.

### Query for Current Context Example

```
GET https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu 
Host: hub
Authorization: Bearer i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe
```

                        }

      ]
   }
}
```


## Request Context Change

Similar to the Hub's notifications to the subscriber, the subscriber MAY request context changes with an HTTP POST to the `hub.topic` url. The Hub SHALL either accept this context change by responding with any successful HTTP status or reject it by responding with any 4xx or 5xx HTTP status. The subscriber SHALL be capable of gracefully handling a rejected context request. 

Once a requested context change is accepted, the Hub SHALL broadcast the context notification to all subscribers, including the original requestor. 

### Request Context Change Request

## Sharing of Structured Information in a Context Container
Multiple applications on a user’s desktop may wish to exchange structured information within a shared context.
Information is added, changed, or removed from a case frequently during such collaborations.  Exchanged information
is transitory and it is not required that the information exchanged during the collaboration is persisted. However,
as required by their use cases, each participating application may choose to persist information in their own structures
which may or may not be expressed as a FHIR resource. Even if stored in the form of a FHIR resource, the resource may or may
not be stored in a system fronted by a FHIR server.

The contextual subjects of Patient, Imaging Study, or a Diagnostic Report may serve as a container of structured information.
Any type of FHIR resource may be added as structured information to the containing contextual subject.  Applications may choose
to participate in information sharing sessions by listening to change-content events and add new information using the update-content
operation. A change or closing of a contextual subject in which content resources are enclosed clears all content.

![Allowed Context Containers for Information Sharing](../img/ContextContainers.png)
*Allowed Context Containers*

It should be noted that *content* and *context* are distinct concepts. A *context* is a circumstance on which multiple
desktop applications agree to synchronize.  *Content* is information which multiple applications agree to share inside of a
given *context*.  While most interactions are the same between *contextual* subjects and their contained *content*, there are some
differences in associated operations and a few additional responsibilities are required of the Hub. Additionally, a given Hub may
or may not support the sharing of structured information. If a Hub does not support sharing of structured information requesting
applications should expect and handle the standard not implemented HTTP error status (501 - Not Implemented) when requesting
one of the structured information sharing operations be performed.

Finally, context resources that act as content containers (i.e. Patient, Imaging Study, and Diagnostic Report) may contain content
of the same or other potential context resources that may be content containers.  For example, a Diagnostic Report acting as a
content container could contain an Imaging Study as a resource in its content.  In another example, an Imaging Study acting as a
content container could contain another Imaging Study in its content - perhaps as a way of noting that the contained Imaging Study
is a prior Imaging Study to the Imaging Study acting as the content container. No validation of the semantic appropriateness of
content is performed by the Hub.

Operations enabling applications to participate sharing structured information are:

* [update content](#update-content-request)
* [get current content](#get-current-content-request)
* [set active resource](#set-active-resource-request)

Responsibilities of a Hub supporting structured information sharing is provided [below](#hub-responsibilities-to-support-sharing-of-structured-information).

### Update Content Request
A subscriber may request to add, remove, or change one or more FHIR resources to the content of a context container with an HTTP
POST to the `hub.topic` url. The Hub SHALL either acknowledge that the request was honored successfully by returning a success
HTTP status (200 - OK) or returning an [HTTP error status](#update-content-request-failure) if the request fails. The Hub
SHALL perform all requested changes atomically and all requested changes must either succeed or the Hub MUST fail the entire
request. The subscriber SHALL be able to appropriately handle a failed update request.

###### Request Update Content Parameters
Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`timestamp` | Required | *string* | ISO 8601-2 timestamp in UTC describing the time at which the event occurred with subsecond accuracy. 
`id` | Required | *string* | Event identifier used to recognize retried notifications. This id SHALL be uniquely generated by the subscriber and could be a GUID.
`event` | Required | *object* | A json object describing the event. See [below](#request-update-content-event-object-parameters).

###### Request Update Content Event Object Parameters
Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`hub.topic` | Required | string | The topic session URI given in the subscription request.
`hub.event`| Required | string | `update-content`<br><br>The event that triggered this request for the subscriber, taken from the list of events from the subscription request.
`container.id` | Required | string | Resource id of the contextual subject in which this content resides
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | ISO 8601-2 timestamp in UTC provided by the Hub when it last updated content
`client.id` | Optional | uri | Identifies the client in a non-variant manner that enables information provided by a client to be determined through multiple open and close cycles.  Only a single subscriber with a given client.id may join a session. 
`content` | Required | Bundle |  A [FHIR Bundle resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) containing the requested content changes.  The Hub SHALL only accept FHIR resources that are authorized to be accessed with the existing OAuth2 `access_token`.

The Bundle Resource holds a list of 1 to n resources which are requested to be added (POST), removed (DELETE) or changed (PUT) in the
content as specified in the request/method attribute of each resource in the bundle.

Each resource MAY contain the `client.id` to the source attribute of the resource’s meta attribute.  In the above example, both
observation resources specify a client id.

###### Resource Protection Levels
In the tag attribute of a resource’s meta attribute an application MAY specify one or more protection levels for the resource.  In
the above example, the head circumference observation resource contains an update restriction while the bone density
observation resource does not specify any protection level.  The following protection levels are available in the
http://fhircast.org/exchange/protection code set:

Code | Meaning
--- | ---
`restrict.update` | No application other than the application that added the resource to the case may update any content of the resource
`restrict.removal`| No application other than the application that added the resource to the case may remove the resource from the case

If a resource does not contain a value in the `source` attribute of the resource's meta attribute, then any protection level is included
in the resource is disregarded.

##### Response Update Content Parameters
Upon successful completion of the request the Hub SHALL return the following response in addition to
returning the HTTP 200 Accepted status.

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`id` | Required | string | Event identifier which was uniquely generated by the requesting subscriber.
`hub.event` | Required | string | `update-content`<br><br>The event that triggered this request from the subscriber.
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | Timestamp generated by the Hub when it updated content based on this request.  This timestamp is used to ensure subsequent request from any subscriber is using the current version of the content.

##### Update Content Request Failure
If the update content request fails, the Hub SHALL respond with one of the below HTTP error status codes corresponding with the described failure
condition.

###### Request Update Content Failure - HTTP Error Status Codes
Code | Meaning | Condition
--- | --- | ---
400 | Bad Request | Some portion of the request was improperly formed or a duplicate `client.id` was provided in the request
401 | Unauthorized | The application was not granted an authorization scope required to add, update, or remove the resource type of one of the FHIR resources in the request
403	| Forbidden	| Update or removal of one of the resources in the request is not permitted by any application except the creator of the resource (see [resource protection levels](#resource-protection-levels))
404	| Not Found	| One of the FHIR resources which is requested to be updated or removed was not found
406 | Not Acceptable | One of the FHIR resources which is requested to be added has an id of a resource already present
410 | Gone | The containing context resource (`container.id`) provided in the request was not found
412 | Precondition Failed | The application is not subscribed to the `hub.topic`
422 | Unprocessable Entity | One of the FHIR resources in the request was structurally malformed

### Get Current Content Request
A subscribing application may request the current content of a context container with an HTTP GET to the `hub.topic` url.  The client
queries the case by the Hub's `hub.topic` url with the `container.id` as a parameter.  Note that no `hub.event` is present in the
response.  If the query is successful the Hub shall respond by returning a success HTTP status (200 - OK), HTTP status (204 - No Content),
or returning an [HTTP error status](#get-current-content-request-failure) if the request was not successful.  The subscriber SHALL be able to appropriately handle
a failed request.

##### Response Get Current Content Parameters
Upon successful completion of the request the Hub SHALL return the following response in addition to returning the HTTP 200 OK status.

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`hub.topic` | Required | string | Event identifier which was uniquely generated by the requesting subscriber.
`hub.event` | Required | string | `get-current-content`<br><br>The event that triggered this request from the subscriber.
`container.id` | Required | string | Resource id of the contextual subject in which this content resides
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | Timestamp provided by the Hub when it last updated content
`content` | Required | array | Resources which are present in the containing contextual subject

###### Get Current Content Example Request

The `content` field holds the resources which are content of the containing contextual subject `container.id`.

##### Get Current Content Request Failure
If the get current content request fails, the Hub SHALL respond with one of the below HTTP error status codes corresponding with the
described failure condition.

###### Get Current Content Failure - HTTP Error Status Codes
Code | Meaning | Condition
--- | --- | ---
400 | Bad Request | Some portion of the request was improperly formed
401 | Unauthorized | The application was not granted an authorization scope required to get the case's current context
410 | Gone | The containing context resource id provided in the request was not found
412 | Precondition Failed | The application is not subscribed to the `hub.topic`
5xx | *per code* | Appropriate status code if a server error occurs

###### Request Get Current Content Failure - Response
If the get current content request fails, the Hub MAY respond with a [FHIR Operation Outcome resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html)
in addition to returning the appropriate HTTP error status code.  The operation outcome `severity` SHALL be 'error' while
the following `code` and `details` values are recommended:

HTTP Status | Code | Details
--- | --- | --- | ---
400 | structure | MSG_BAD_SYNTAX
401 | forbidden | MSG_AUTH_REQUIRED
410 | not-found | MSG_NO_EXIST
412 | unknown | MSG_AUTH_REQUIRED
5xx | transient | *not applicable*

### Set Active Resource Request
A subscriber may request a resource be noted as being active with an HTTP POST to the `hub.topic` url.  The Hub SHALL either acknowledge
that the request was honored successfully by returning a success HTTP status (200 - OK) or returning
an [HTTP error status](#set-active-resource-request-failure) if the request was not successful. Support of this operation by a Hub is
optional even for Hub's wishing to support the sharing of structured information.  If a Hub does not support the set active resource
operation then it would return the standard not implemented HTTP error status (501 - Not Implemented) if the operation is requested. The
subscriber SHALL be able to appropriately handle a failed set active resource request.

Noting a resource as active allows applications to react to a user’s selection of structured information in another application.
Hence an application may want to set (or clear) an active resource with others reacting to the selection if appropriate.  For example,
a reporting system may indicate that the user has selected a particular observation with a measurement value and an imaging application
which created the measurement may wish to change its user display such that the image from which the measurement was acquired is visible.
If a resource is noted as active, this indicates that any other resource which was active is no longer active (i.e. there is an implicit
inactive).

###### Set Active Resource Parameters
Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`timestamp` | Required | *string* | ISO 8601-2 timestamp in UTC describing the time at which the event occurred with subsecond accuracy. 
`id` | Required | *string* | Event identifier used to recognize retried notifications. This id SHALL be uniquely generated by the subscriber and could be a GUID.
`event` | Required | *object* | A json object describing the event. See [below](#set-active-resource-in-case-event-object-parameters).

###### Set Active Resource Event Object Parameters
Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`hub.topic` | Required | string | The topic session URI given in the subscription request.
`hub.event` | Required | string | `remove-resource-from-case`<br>The event that triggered this request from the subscriber, taken from the list of events from the subscription request.
`container.id` | Required | string | Resource id of the contextual subject in which this content resides
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | Timestamp provided by the Hub when it last updated content
`resource.id` | Required | string | FHIR resource id that should be noted as active, if `resource.id` is an empty string then the requesting application is noting that nothing is selected

##### Response Set Active Resource Parameters
Upon successful completion of the request the Hub SHALL return the following response in addition to returning the HTTP 200 status.

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`id` | Required | string | Event identifier which was uniquely generated by the requesting subscriber.
`hub.event` | Required | string | `set-active-resource-in-case`<br><br>The event that triggered this request from the subscriber.
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | Timestamp generated by the Hub when it changed the selected resource based on this request.  This timestamp is used to ensure subsequent request from any subscriber is using the current version of the content.

##### Set Active Resource Request Failure
If the set active resource request fails, the Hub SHALL respond with one of the below HTTP error status codes corresponding with the
described failure condition.

###### Set Active Failure - HTTP Error Status Codes
Code | Meaning | Condition
--- | --- | ---
400 | Bad Request | Some portion of the request was improperly formed
401 | Unauthorized | The application was not granted an authorization scope required to note as active the resource type of the FHIR resource requested to be made active
404	| Not Found	| The resource which is requested to be noted as active was not found in the case
410 | Gone | The containing context resource id provided in the request was not found
412 | Precondition Failed | The application is not subscribed to the `hub.topic`
428 | Precondition Required | The `content.timestamp` in the submitted request is not the current timestamp of the content held by the Hub
5xx | *per code* | Appropriate status code if a server error occurs

###### Request Set Active Resource Failure - Response
If the set active resource request fails, the Hub MAY respond with a [FHIR Operation Outcome resource](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html)
in addition to returning the appropriate HTTP error status code.  The operation outcome `severity` SHALL be 'error' while
the following `code` and `details` values are recommended:

HTTP Status | Code | Details
--- | --- | --- | ---
400 | structure | MSG_BAD_SYNTAX
401 | forbidden | MSG_AUTH_REQUIRED
404 | not-found | MSG_NO_EXIST
410 | not-found | MSG_NO_EXIST
412 | unknown | MSG_AUTH_REQUIRED
428 | conflict | MSG_VERSION_AWARE_CONFLICT
5xx | transient | *not applicable*

##### Set Active Resource Notification Parameters
The Hub SHALL send the following event to all other applications participating in the case if the request was successfully completed.  The requesting application
SHALL not be sent this event.  The Hub SHALL not send any notification to other applications if the request fails.

Field | Optionality | Type | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`timestamp` | Required | string | ISO 8601-2 timestamp in UTC describing the time at which the event occurred with subsecond accuracy.
`id` | Required | string | Event identifier used to recognize retried notifications. This id SHALL be uniquely generated by the subscriber and could be a GUID. Following an accepted context change request, the hub MAY re-use this value in the broadcasted event notifications.
`event` | Required | object | A json object describing the event, see [below](#set-active-resource-in-case-notification-event-object-parameters).

##### Set Active Resource Notification Event Object Parameters

`hub.event` | Required | string | `remove-resource-from-case`<br>The event that triggered this request from the subscriber, taken from the list of events from the subscription request.
`container.id` | Required | string | Resource id of the contextual subject in which this content resides
`content.timestamp` | Required | string | Timestamp provided by the Hub when it last updated content
`resource.id` | Required | string | FHIR resource id that should be noted as active, if `resource.id` is an empty string then no resource is active

### Hub Responsibilities to Support Sharing of Structured Information
In order to support the sharing of structured information a Hub must support the following responsibilities:
  1. Support the [update content](#update-content-request) and [get current content](#get-current-content-request) requests
  2. Support of the [set active resource](#set-active-resource-request) is optional
  3. Maintain the current state of shared resources in order to support the [get current content](#get-current-content-request) and validate parameters of requested operations as described in each operation
  4. Optionally enforce data protection levels
  5. Ensure the structural validity of FHIR resources
  6. Ensure that a specific `client.id` in any request uses the same token as when a given `client.id` was first encountered

A Hub is not responsible for any long-term persistence of shared information and should purge the content when the containing contextual
subject is closed.

## Event Notification Errors

If the subscriber cannot follow the context of the event, for instance due to an error or a deliberate choice to not follow a context, the subscriber MAY respond with a 'sync-error' event. The Hub MAY use these events to track synchronization state and MAY also forward these events to other subscribers of the same topic.

### Event Notification Error Example

```
POST https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu HTTP/1.1
Host: hub
Authorization: Bearer i8hweunweunweofiwweoijewiwe
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "timestamp": "2018-01-08T01:37:05.14",
  "id": "q9v3jubddqt63n1",
  "event": {
    "hub.topic": "https://hub.example.com/7jaa86kgdudewiaq0wtu",
    "hub.event": "sync-error",
    "context": [
      {
        "key": "operationoutcome",
        "resource": {
          "resourceType": "OperationOutcome",
          "issue": [
            {
              "severity": "warning",
              "code": "processing",
              "diagnostics": "AppId3456 failed to follow context"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Event Catalog
Each event definition in the catalog, below, specifies a single event name, a description of the event, and the  required or optional contextual information associated with the event. Alongside the event name, the contextual information is used by the subscriber.

FHIR is the interoperable data model used by FHIRcast. The fields within `context` are subsets of FHIR resources. Hubs MUST send the results of FHIR reads in the context, as specified below. For example, when the `open-image-study` event occurs, the notification sent to a subscriber MUST include the ImagingStudy FHIR resource. Hubs SHOULD send the results of an ImagingStudy FHIR read using the *_elements* query parameter, like so:  `ImagingStudy/{id}?_elements=identifier,accession` and in accordance with the [FHIR specification](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#elements). 

A FHIR server may not support the *_elements* query parameter; a subscriber MUST gracefully handle receiving a full FHIR resource in the context of a notification.

The name of the event SHOULD succinctly and clearly describe the activity or event. Event names are unique so event creators SHOULD take care to ensure newly proposed events do not conflict with an existing event name. Event creators SHALL name their event with reverse domain notation (e.g. `org.example.patient-transmogrify`) if the event is specific to an organization. Reverse domain notation SHALL not be used by a standard event catalog.

The context object shall contain exactly one Resource of type [*Bundle*](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html) with all affected resource(s) in its `entry` field. Each `entry` MUST carry a `request` and a `resource` field with the following interpretation:

* `entry.request.method` type of operation the user performed on the resource
    * PUT = User created the Resource
    * DELETE = User deleted the Resource
    * POST = User updated the Resource
* `entry.request.resource` the *complete* resource object for PUT and POST operations
or the resource object including a unique identifier for DELETE operations

### user-logout
